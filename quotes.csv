 strong homeostatic sleepiness: this usually means going to sleep not earlier than 15-19 hours after awakening from the previous night sleep

 Open socialization means a natural, self-regulating flow of actors in the socialization game. Openness is punitive for bad actors, liberating for weaker actors, and educational for everyone.
 Free socialization means minimal interference from the adult world. There is nothing wrong with parents playing matchmakers.

Students of the world unite! You no longer need to suffer the pain of learning. If you suffer, you have your basic student right to protest. If you suffer, something is going wrong! You can stop learning! If anyone demands learning from you, and you do not enjoy it, you can strike back, and demand pleasurable learning! This is not your elitist hedonistic weak heart demand.

Schools fail because they disrespect and suppress basic learning, creativity, and problem solving mechanisms. For institutions responsible for fostering science, schools are egregiously ignorant of essential principles of how the brain works|Piotr Wozniak|https://supermemo.guru/wiki/I_would_never_send_my_kids_to_school|I would never send my kids to school
Focus on short-term outcomes in schooling results in pressures extending well beyond the optimum push zone|Piotr Wozniak|https://supermemo.guru/wiki/I_would_never_send_my_kids_to_school|I would never send my kids to school
